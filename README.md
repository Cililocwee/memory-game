# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is the Memory Card Game?

This is a simple game in which the user must click UNIQUE cards in order. The first time a user clicks the same card for a second time, the level resets. Each difficulty has a different number of cards that present. Easy starts with 12 cards, Medium has 24, and Hard has a full 49 cards. 

## Why React?

React's component states make keeping track of previously selected cards a breeze. By keeping the state updated in the parent component, child components are successfully rerendered and shuffled on each click.
